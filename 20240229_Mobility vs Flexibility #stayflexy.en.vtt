technically flexibility unless I move
 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.670 align:start position:0%
technically flexibility unless I move
now<00:00:20.240><c> it's</c><00:00:20.480><c> considered</c><00:00:21.039><c> mobility</c><00:00:22.039><c> and</c><00:00:22.359><c> watch</c>

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
now it's considered mobility and watch
 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.070 align:start position:0%
now it's considered mobility and watch
this<00:00:23.080><c> this</c><00:00:23.199><c> is</c><00:00:23.400><c> still</c><00:00:23.680><c> all</c><00:00:24.000><c> Mobility</c><00:00:24.519><c> Mobility</c>

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
this this is still all Mobility Mobility

this this is still all Mobility Mobility
Mobility<00:00:25.840><c> Mobility</c><00:00:26.840><c> now</c><00:00:27.039><c> it's</c><00:00:27.320><c> just</c>

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
Mobility Mobility now it's just
 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.669 align:start position:0%
Mobility Mobility now it's just
flexibility<00:00:28.880><c> so</c><00:00:29.279><c> what's</c><00:00:29.519><c> better</c><00:00:30.000><c> flexibility</c>

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 align:start position:0%
flexibility so what's better flexibility
 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.150 align:start position:0%
flexibility so what's better flexibility
or<00:00:30.920><c> Mobility</c><00:00:31.880><c> well</c><00:00:32.119><c> that's</c><00:00:32.320><c> kind</c><00:00:32.480><c> of</c><00:00:32.599><c> a</c><00:00:32.719><c> silly</c>

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
or Mobility well that's kind of a silly
 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.910 align:start position:0%
or Mobility well that's kind of a silly
question<00:00:33.640><c> because</c><00:00:34.239><c> you</c><00:00:34.480><c> can't</c><00:00:34.840><c> have</c><00:00:35.079><c> Mobility</c>

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
question because you can't have Mobility
 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.470 align:start position:0%
question because you can't have Mobility
without<00:00:36.320><c> that</c><00:00:36.559><c> flexibility</c><00:00:37.520><c> so</c><00:00:37.719><c> flexibility</c>

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
without that flexibility so flexibility
 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.910 align:start position:0%
without that flexibility so flexibility
wins<00:00:39.000><c> by</c><00:00:39.280><c> default</c><00:00:40.039><c> which</c><00:00:40.160><c> means</c><00:00:40.480><c> the</c><00:00:40.600><c> best</c><00:00:40.800><c> way</c>

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
to get more mobile is to get flexible
