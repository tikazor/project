very much of my body. With stretching,

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
it's a similar concept. Oh boy, here we

it's a similar concept. Oh boy, here we

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
when your stretch reflex relaxes so that
 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.349 align:start position:0%
when your stretch reflex relaxes so that
you<00:00:19.840><c> can</c><00:00:20.000><c> sink</c><00:00:20.320><c> a</c><00:00:20.480><c> little</c><00:00:20.560><c> bit</c><00:00:20.720><c> deeper.</c><00:00:21.119><c> It's</c>

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
you can sink a little bit deeper. It's
 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.109 align:start position:0%
you can sink a little bit deeper. It's
been<00:00:21.520><c> about</c><00:00:21.680><c> 15</c><00:00:22.080><c> seconds.</c><00:00:22.400><c> I'm</c><00:00:22.640><c> sinking</c><00:00:22.880><c> a</c>

been about 15 seconds. I'm sinking a
 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.109 align:start position:0%
been about 15 seconds. I'm sinking a

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
little deeper. Hopefully, you can see
 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.790 align:start position:0%
little deeper. Hopefully, you can see
the<00:00:25.359><c> difference</c><00:00:25.519><c> there.</c><00:00:26.080><c> So,</c><00:00:26.240><c> the</c><00:00:26.480><c> equivalent</c>

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
the difference there. So, the equivalent
 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.710 align:start position:0%
the difference there. So, the equivalent
to<00:00:26.960><c> stretching</c><00:00:27.279><c> till</c><00:00:27.599><c> failure</c><00:00:27.920><c> is</c><00:00:28.160><c> stretching</c>

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
to stretching till failure is stretching
 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.870 align:start position:0%
to stretching till failure is stretching
until<00:00:29.279><c> you</c><00:00:29.519><c> sink</c><00:00:29.760><c> a</c><00:00:29.920><c> little</c><00:00:30.080><c> bit</c><00:00:30.240><c> deeper</c><00:00:30.640><c> and</c>

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
until you sink a little bit deeper and
 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.630 align:start position:0%
until you sink a little bit deeper and
then<00:00:31.119><c> you</c><00:00:31.279><c> hold</c><00:00:31.519><c> it.</c><00:00:31.840><c> You</c><00:00:32.000><c> tend</c><00:00:32.160><c> to</c><00:00:32.320><c> get</c><00:00:32.480><c> better</c>

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
then you hold it. You tend to get better
 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.229 align:start position:0%
then you hold it. You tend to get better
at<00:00:32.880><c> the</c><00:00:33.040><c> things</c><00:00:33.200><c> that</c><00:00:33.360><c> you</c><00:00:33.520><c> focus</c><00:00:33.840><c> on.</c><00:00:34.079><c> And</c>

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 align:start position:0%
at the things that you focus on. And
 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:35.750 align:start position:0%
at the things that you focus on. And
right<00:00:34.399><c> now,</c><00:00:34.640><c> you're</c><00:00:34.880><c> focusing</c><00:00:35.280><c> on</c><00:00:35.600><c> your</c>

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
right now, you're focusing on your

right now, you're focusing on your

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
phone. So, maybe you should do something
 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
phone. So, maybe you should do something
